## Whiteboard Web App

This is a whiteboard web app created using [React](https://reactjs.org/). It allows you to:
- Draw lines
- Change the canvas color using the [React Color picker](https://casesandberg.github.io/react-color/#examples)
- Erase the canvas

The data persists across browser sessions by leveraging local storage.
